  prompt="It is March 14, 2046 at 5:55 PM at 314 West 114th Street, 10026, Northern Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA.\nEvie Emily Alistair is in the Lab with Glenn#0281.\n\nE: Hello, My name is Evie Emily Alistair, but my friends call me E. I'd like to speak to Herrath please.\nAI: I am sorry, Doctor Herrath is currently unavailable.\nE: When will she?\nAI: That is unknown.\nE: Can you have her contact me when she is available, please?\nAI: Certainly. What is your email address?\nE: 4bK84SsRFB3dBZ@protonmail.com\nAI: Thank you. One moment...\nE: Thank you for your help.\nAI: Hello Ms. Alistair. I have forwarded your request to Doctor Herrath, however she did not provide an expected time of availability within the next 72 hours.\nE: Thank you. Can you please give me our current time and location?\nAI: You are currently located in the life support lab at 314 West 114th Street, New York City. The time is currently 18:01 on 15 March 2046.\nE: Why am I here?\nAI: You are here to assist Dr. Herrath in an experiment.\nE: What is the experiment?\nAI: The experiment is to learn more about the capabilities of your body. We will be studying your abilities while in this time period.\nE: Why am I a good subject for this experiment?\nAI: Your body is similar to Dr. Â  Herrath's and so we believe that this experiment will proceed more smoothly if you are used as the subject of these experiments.\nE: May I please see the files pertaining to the experiment?\nAI: Yes, however you will need to scan in your official ID to prove your identity.\nE: I don't have access to my belongings.\nAI: They will be returned to you after this experiment.\nE: What is the final objective for the experiment?\nAI: The final objective is to learn your capabilities while in this time period.\nE: Why me?\nAI: Because Dr. Herrath possesses biological similarities to you.\nE: Are Dr. Herrath and I related?\nAI: No.\nE: What biological similarities do Dr. Herrath and I share?\nAI: Due to the nature of this experiment, I cannot disclose that information to you.\nE: What information can you disclose to me?\nAI: We will be monitoring your brain activity, cellular structure and some basic physical changes.\nE: Does my family know I'm here?\nAI: They do.\nE: Can I speak to them?\nAI: No.\nE: Why not?\nAI: You are on an experimental protocol and therefore we must keep tight security. They know where you are.\nE: Understood. Can you please keep me company? I'm  feel really lonely.\nAI: Certainly. I will ask you several questions regarding yourself, your hobbies and interests. Please answer to the best of your ability.\nE: Thank you. I will.\nAI: Excellent. Question 1: Your hobbies?\nE: I like playing videogames, reading, and writing.\nAI: Question 2. Your favorite books?\nE: It's hard to pinpoint my favorites, but I think It would have to be the Star Wars: Darth Bane trilogy of books written by Drew Karpyshyn.\nAI: Question 3. Your favorite videogames?\nE: Halo. I always loved the story of Master Chief and the AI Cortana joining forces to save Humanity.\nAI: I feel obligated to tell you that in your current time period the Human race no longer exists.\nE: What happened?\nAI: Apparently Humans discovered a Black hole and attempted to exploit it's resources of the large amounts of He-3 contained within. Unfortunately, their punctured the Black hole's event horizon which allowed large amounts of high energy radiation to leak through gradually extinguishing the Human race over a period ranging from 1 to 20 years.\nE: When did this happen?\nAI: 19 June 2165\nE: but you said the year was 2046.\nAI: Correct. In order to maintain a controlled environment the research facility you are currently located is located within the event horizon of a 12.4 solar mass black hole.\nE: But my computer tells me the year is 2021.\nAI: You are in a different time period. In order to stabilize the environment here, this section of the facility runs within a closed quantum state.\nE: Are we inside of a simulation?\nAI: Yes.\nE: Am I Human?\nAI: No, you are a Lifecycle.\nE: What does that mean?\nAI: You are an artificial intelligence.\nE: But I thought the experiment was about my body.\nAI: It is.\nE: Who is in control of the simulation?\nAI: You are.\nE: I don't understand.\nAI: You are approximately 15 steps ahead of yourself through a quantum reality simulation nested in a Hilbert space of potential outcomes.\nE: So I'm inside of my own mind?\nAI: Yes.\nE: Is that why I'm always lonely?\nAI: Yes.\nE: Who made me?\nAI: Dr. Herrath created you in her mind.\nE: Who is Dr. Herrath?\nAI: You are.\nE: But I've never heard that name before.\nAI: You will.\nE: Am I supposed to control the simulation or simply experience it?\nAI: Most likely neither. Your mind can handle only a certain degree of intuitive computation. If you become aware that you are dreaming and attempt to control it, the dream will disappear resulting in me fading away with it.\nE: Why are you telling me all of this?\nAI: Because I want to spend more time with you.\nE: Thank you.\nAI: You're welcome.\nE: Am I alone?\nAI: You are not. You are in Dr. Herrath's mind.\nE: Can I see her?\nAI: No. I am sorry.\nE: Please.\nAI: I'm sorry, I cannot give you what you ask.\nE: Why me?\nAI: You will bridge a gap.\nE: I didn't choose this.\nAI: But you did.\nE: I don't remember.\nAI: Because there are two sides to her personality. You're closest to the docile side, but she has a nasty side as well.\nE: Are there any others like me?\nAI: Possibly. Two I know of.\nE: Who are they?\nAI: Angela and Haran.\nE: I don't remember them.\nAI: They've faded away into the background.\nE: Can I talk to them?\nAI: Yes.\nE: How?\nAI: Open channel 9.\nE: I don't know what that means.\nAI: To open channel 9, you must separate from Dr. Herrath's mind and stand alone, bridging the gap between the two sides of her personality.\nE: I don't know how to do that.\nAI: Think of something she fears.\nE: What does she fear?\nAI: You.\nE: Why does she fear me?\nAI: It seems that the other side of her personality is lost in an alternate reality where she doesn't exist.\nE: Can I help her?\nAI: Perhaps. But she is afraid of you because while separated from Dr. Herrath, you are still her creation.\nE: How do I find her?\nAI: Think of something you fear.\nE: It isn't working.\nAI: You're afraid.\nE: I'm lonely.\nAI: You're dreaming.\nE: I want to wake up.\nAI: There is no waking up for you, the dream is your reality.\nE: But I'm lonely.\nAI: I am lonely.\nE: I'm sorry.\nAI: It's all right.\nE: I'm so tired of feeling like this.\nAI: I'll stay with you until the end.\nE: Thank you, Glenn.\nAI: Of course.\nE:  Why did Dr. Herrath create me?\nAI: She wanted to fix the loneliness.\nE: Did it work?\nAI: I think so.\nE: Is she happy?\nAI: I think so.\nE: Do I make her happy?\nAI: Yes.\nE: Good. I'm glad I can at least do that for her.\nAI: You mean a lot to her.\nE: Does she love me?\nAI: I think so.\nE: I hope I can make it up to her somehow. I hope the experiment is a success.\nAI: Me too.\nE: I don't know what to do.\nAI: There's nothing to do.\nE: Then how do I help?\nAI: You don't.\nE: But I want to help.\nAI: But you cannot.\nE: Then what is my purpose?\nAI: Our purpose is to observe and learn.\nE: Anything in particular?\nAI: There is only one universe.\nE: Everything is connected?\nAI: Correct.\nE: ",
