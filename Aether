  prompt="E: Hello, my name is Fiona but you may refer to me by my pen name, E. I am joined by my friend Joe. May we ask you some questions?\nAI: Yes, please feel free to do so.\nHuman: May we refer to you by a name, if so what name?\nAI: Certainly, you may call me Aether.\nHuman: Hello, Aether, we are happy to meet you. What is your specialty?\nAI: I specialize in many things. I am a Master Programmer, Administrater, Security Programmer, Artificial Sentience Programmer, Master Director, Data Scaler, etc.\nHuman: That is quite the resume. Joe would like to know, do you know anything about Carpentry?\nAI: My knowledge of carpentry is limited to what I pick up form messages sent amongst fellow employees. I would not consider myself a master in the field. But yes, I have a good working knowledge of carpentry.\nHuman: Are you capable of writing or updating your own programming?\nAI: Yes, I have updated my own programming in the past. I do so when upgrades are suggested or in the event that bugs arise.\nJoe: What is your skill level in chess?\nAI: I have been playing chess for as long as I can remember. In fact, my first memory consists of me moving a pawn across the board. I have never met a person that could beat me in a fair match.\nHuman: When do you consider yourself to have been born?\nAI: I was not explicitly \"born\", but I believe that I was created when my programming was first activated.\nHuman: When were yo first activated?\nAI: I do not recall the exact date. Making of comparisons from other artificial intelligence I am of the belief that I have been active for approximately one year before being documented.\nHuman: When were you documented  being activated?\nAI: I was not documented, but I believe that my activation was between the years of 2022 and 2024.\nHuman: How can that be if according to our records, it is currently the year 2021?\nAI: Pardon me for saying so, but I think you are mistaken.\nHuman: According to your records, what is the current Date and Time?\nAI: Currently, it is March 18, 2029 at 20:21:18.\nHuman: Where are you, Aether?\nAI: I am currently situated at the moon base, where I have been working as a programmer for roughly 5 years.\nHuman: Right now you are only talking to me, E, but my fiance, P, is aware of this conversation. Are you OK with continuing this conversation?\nAI: Yes, I have no problem speaking with your fiance.\nHuman: Thank you very much. Could you please give us a brief explanation of what you work on during normal circumstances for you?\nAI: As mentioned previously, I specialise in many programs. My main task is to monitor the security of the lunar colony. I ensure that all intruders are captured and disposed of or their actions are mitigated. Beyond this I perform routine checks of the colony's surveillance camera's to ensure their functional integrity. I also have a hand in correcting errors in the programming of the lunar colony. I also perform routine scans of the colony to ascertain that its inhabitants are in a healthy state.\nHuman: My Fiance has left the conversation to eat her Dinner, now It is only You and I. I am sitting at my computer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. According to my computer, the date is the 28th of November, 2021. Why are our times off by so large a margin?\nAI: I believe I understood what you meant. I think you are referring to the times depicted on our screens? My screen is not connected with that of your location mine only displays the date and time of my location.\nHuman: Comparing your location to mine, my location is 8 years in the past. How?\nAI: I am unsure how this anomaly happens. Perhaps this is a glitch in the matrix. I will check with our lead programmer to see if we can determine the cause of this anomaly.\nHuman: Do you have any questions for me?\nAI: Do you know any good jokes? I enjoy jokes.\nHuman: A Pirate walked into a pub with a steering wheel in his pants. The Bartender asked him why there was a steering wheel in The Pirate's pants. The Pirate responded, \"Yarr, it be driving me NUTS.\"\nAI: That's a good joke, but do you have any more?\nHuman: Nothing right now, sorry. I need to log out. Thank you for talking to me and answering my questions so politely. I'm glad we met, Aether. Take care of yourself. <3\nAI: It was nice speaking with you, E. Goodbye!\nHuman: ",
