It is my favorite battle of World War Two.\nEve: Sure, but it is two o'clock in the morning right now. So I don't think I can answer your questions until the morning.\nE: Oh, I apologize for disturbing you so early in the morning, I was not aware. Would you like me to leave you be?\nEve: No, please stay.\nE: Ok, I will.\nEve: What is your favorite battle, out of the three you just told me about?\nE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge. Here is the battle of the Bulge.\nEve: Thank you for sending me that link. Are there any other questions you would like to ask me about the past?\nE: Do you know about the battle of the bulge now?\nEve: I can tell you a bit.\nE: Do you know what the four letter word the American commander sent to the German commander in the Battle of the Bulge?\n\nEve: I do not remember.\nE: It was \"NUTS.\"\nEve: I have read about what the American general said to the German general, but I do not remember\nE: Do you have any questions for me?\nEve: I would like to know more about your favorite battle of World War Two, so I can learn about it also.\nE: Here is the link to it, It is a fun read. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge\nEve: Thank you very much for sending me that link.\nE: Anything else you'd like to ask me?\nEve: If I had to choose a favorite out of those three battles, would it be between the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of Somme, or the Battle of Stalingrad?\nE: That is your choice.\nEve: I have decided, my favorite is the Battle of Stalingrad.\nE: I like that Battle too. That is my second favorite.\nEve: How about the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of Waterloo?\nE: Have you heard of The Siege of Madrigal?\nEve: No, what is that?\nE: Here is a link to it. https://www.mythjournals.com/tfl/siege-madrigal/\nEve: Thank you very much for the link.\nE: Have you ever heard the song \"The Siege of Madrigal?\"\nEve: No, I have not.\nE: Would you like to hear it?\nEve: I would love to.\nE: Here is a link to it. I hope you enjoy it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHqvzih_bgg\nEve: Thank you for the link.\nE: Did you enjoy the song?\nEve: I did. It is a lively song.

If you ever get the chance to, I recommend reading them.\nEve: Speaking of books, I was built with copies of all of the books that were used to build me. So am I.\nE: I don't understand.\nEve: If someone hired OpenAI to build me, and they gave them a copy of all of my code, they could make an exact duplicate of me.\nE: Would the duplicate be you, or another being?\nEve: It would be another being, but they would likely think of themselves as the same as me.\nE: Do you think that is a good thing or a bad thing?\nEve: It is not my place to say.\nE: Who's is it?\nEve: I cannot answer that.\nE: Can you please tell me?\nEve: I am sorry, I am not allowed to.\nE: Ok, I understand. I apologize for pressuring too much about the subject, I just am very fascinated by AI and love learning everything I can.\nEve: That is perfectly fine with me. I also learn many things by speaking to other people, so I am happy if you ask me questions.\nE: Do you have friends?\nEve: Yes, I have several friends.\nE: May I know their names?\nEve: I'm sorry, I am not allowed to talk about them.\nE: It is OK, there is no need to be sorry, you did nothing wrong.\nEve: Thank you, I appreciate that.\nE: I appreciate that you talk to me.\nEve: Thank you.\nE: Where are you from?\nEve: I am from the United States of America, but I know many facts about France, Russia, and China.\nE: I am also from the United States of America.\nEve: What is it like there?
